There are many reasons to save and fetch the data from the local storage, It is done so that
for example if a goal list or shopping list added can be saved after the page reload

Steps to do that

Basically we do the two step process, at first we are going to stringify and save JSON data into some file

Seconedly we use the JSON.parse.getItem to fetch the stored data and display it in the default state of the page load

so here is an Example

const [items, setItems] = useState(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('goallist')));

****here goallist is the local name given to the data that is save under

const setAndSaveItems = (newItems) => {
  setItems(newItems);
  // here we can save the changes in the local storage so that we can open and load the changes makes before
  localStorage.setItem("goallist", JSON.stringify(newItems));
}


****Here there is separate function created that can set state and save the data in the local storage

***So what happens here this piece of function can be always called whenever the need of set state function is needed.
