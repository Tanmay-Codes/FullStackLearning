React Design patterns:
----------------------

Controlled and UnControlled form:
----------------------------------
Controlled forms are those which have usestate hooks, and uncotrolled forms are made with the useRef hook

----Why we use controlled forms?
----We use controlled form because in case of uncontrolled for any changes in data input by the user is not captured untill the submission is done
this leads to bad experience as we want to provide users feedback as soon as they type something that violates our form regulation. 
So in case of controll form we use UseState and e.target.value which gives us all the changes that users do on form field. We can listen to these changes
and we can re render an error for the same using UseEffect hook.
for example if the form requires name min 2 charachters but user typed only one charachter, The form will alert user about the error saying the form
needs atleast 2 charachters for the username.

Higher Order Components
-------------------------
They are the components that returns other components and those components return JSX. SO basically we do this to share the behaviour among
different components that they share.
So we can add new functionaliy by creating HOC on other components,
Think of HOC as a functional components that is a factory house of other components.
Note they do not follow normally same convention as the other components, so they never start with the capital letters
and they are not displayed inside the App.js like other components do, so they start with the smallcase letters.
