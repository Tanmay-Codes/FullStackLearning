1. Important to know that the react router dom is updated to v6, but here I am using
npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0

older version of react router dom that uses the switch instead of routes.


2. .env file is made with the link that looks into the asset folder, but 
there is a thing to remember is that the react aplication works only if the
url name starts with REACT_APP
here like in this case if the name suppose to be "PUBLIC_FOLDER"
then it is actually suppose to be working only if we give it name:
REACT_APP_PUBLIC_FOLDER

3. Note in order to fetch data from api, we use to edit the package json in client
so after everything we ill add proxy, see example in this project


4. Timeago was returning warning si the alternative is used here, called moment, so npm install moment
and then import moment from moment and then use moment("given date here").fromNow() this will return a string
like 1 hour ago.
