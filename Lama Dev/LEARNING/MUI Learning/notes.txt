MUI Buttons
------------

-Use stack with spacing and direction as props to build the layout like you do for the case of Divs

-Use buttons with the variant as a props and variants as (Outlined, Contained, text) , THe href can be added with a link to
change the button to anchor tag

- Can also add Icons to the buttons, Use the  StartIcon props and in it invoce the icon for example sendIcon is a mui Icon then
<Button variant='contained' sendIcon={<startIcon/>} />

- simar to startIcon we can do endIcon to keep the Icon in the button next to the text

- We can a button with the Icon, using the IconButton so for example the send button
<IconButton area-label-'sebd'> <sendIcon/> IconButton/>

Using Styled components and breakpoints
----------------------------------------
import { styled } from "@mui/material/styles";

const StyledToolbar = styled(Toolbar)(({ theme }) => ({
  [theme.breakpoints.up("lg")]: {
    width: "1200px",
    margin: "0 auto",
  },
  display: "flex",
  justifyContent: "space-between",
}));

Note this is important to understand that importing styled in this way only to make it work
Also note that to make the breakpoint actually responsive, here i have use up lg which is above 1200px so 1200px below 
there is different behaviour and above 1200px this size of width given is fix. But if I have done up sm which is above 600ox
then the width size of 1200px will be fixed till the screen size reaches 600px, so for any screen in between that will break
the responsiveness of the code.

Form Control and Form Control Label
-----------------------------------
Note that the form control is different it holds the form label and on screen the form label contains the prop
label that will be dislpayed
and for example when you have to make a checkbox like thing that says I accepts the terms and conditions then
in thant case make sure to include the formControlLabel and make then the label of that string and inside it there is
another prop called the control which holds the Checkbox for example

<FormControlLabel> Label='some string here' control={<Checkbox/>} />

Menu Item
------------
Note we can be confused about the positioing of the pop over and we can check it positioning any time in MUI docs components POPPVER
